            <b>Description:</b> This is a pretty simple unit converter that converts most of the common measurements in day to day life.
            More conversions and units could easily be added if wanted or needed. The current units are just what I felt like implmenting at first. 
            This is most likely not the best or most efficient way of doing things, but I'm kind of noob.</br>
